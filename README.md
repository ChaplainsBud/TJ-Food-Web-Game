Clean Up: Put frontend in folder, backend in folder, and resources in folder. 
--------

Food Web: Choose your ecosystem. Start at the simplest. As you win, advance to next level of complexity. 

*. Provide 7 ecosystems to choose from. Background image. 

I. Terrestrial:

1. Forests
2. Deserts
3. Grasslands
4. Tundra
5. Mountain

II. Aquatic: 
6. Freshwater
7. Marine 

Step 1: Placeholders
Step 2: Optimize images

0. Three Levels for Each Ecosystem: simple, medium, complex. 

If I can register users for a session, not long-term, I can let them play without authentication.

Delete each user after game play is terminated.

Benefit: Easily play, but also go through the route of finishing each ecosystem and eventually winning a prize.

Prize: To be determined. Maybe a video on Nature from YouTube. 

1. Game Concept: place each organism into one of eight categories: 

i. Producer
ii. Primary Consumer
iii. Secondary Consumer
iv. Tertiary Consumer
v. Quaternary Consumer
vi. Apex Predator
vii. Ominoveres
viii. Detrivores

2. Immediate Feedback: Green Check if Yes; Red X if No. Alert with a hint? 

3. The Set-up: OnLoad: 

A Hypothetical Food Web

Producer: Algae

Primary Consumer: Zooplankton

Secondary Consumer: Small Fish (e.g., Minnows)

Tertiary Consumer: Larger Fish (e.g., Salmon)

Quaternary Consumer: Seagull

Apex Predator: Orca (Killer Whale)

Omnivore: Bear (if living near a coastal area, it might eat both fish and berries)

Detrivore: Crabs (feeding on dead organisms and decaying matter)

Note: This is a simplified example, and real-world food webs are often more complex with overlapping relationships and various interconnected food chains.
